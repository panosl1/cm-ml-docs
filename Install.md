# Installing the Machine Learning RPMs


As of Bright Cluster Manager 7.3 a number of Machine/Deep Learning librariy and framework RPM packages have been included.  Bright makes it faster and easier for organizations to gain actionable insights from rich, complex data using the latest, state-of-the-art libraries with minimal effort during installation.

Currently the following RPMs are available:

------------ | -------------
cm-ml-distdeps | Meta-package containing library dependencies available from the base Linux distribution repositories as well as the EPEL repository
cm-ml-pythondeps | Pre-packaged Python dependencies for Bright's RPM packages
Caffe | A deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
Torch | A library in C++ for developing Open Source speech and machine learning applications. 
Theano | Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. 
TensorFlow | TensorFlow is an Open Source Software Library for Machine Intelligence
CuDNN | A GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks.
CUB |  Reusable software components for CUDA
NCCL | (pronounced "Nickel") A stand-alone library of standard collective communication routines, such as all-gather, reduce, broadcast, etc., that have been optimized to achieve high bandwidth over PCIe.
